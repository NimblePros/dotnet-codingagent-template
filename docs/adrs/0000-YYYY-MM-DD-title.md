# ADR 0000: Use .NET 10 for This Solution

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a .NET framework version that provides modern language features, long-term support, and performance improvements for this template repository.

## Decision
We will use .NET 10.0 as the target framework for all projects in this solution.

## Consequences
Projects will benefit from the latest C# language features and runtime performance improvements, but will require developers to have .NET 10 SDK installed.

## Alternatives Considered
We considered using .NET 8 LTS but chose .NET 10 for access to the newest framework capabilities and language features.
